In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.
OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python. To install them, simply run this pip command in your terminal: pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
To run the project : python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>
